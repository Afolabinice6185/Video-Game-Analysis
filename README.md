Insight: Japan appears to be the strongest market for video games in this dataset, highlighting regional preferences and strong demand.

## Recommendations

1. Focus on Action and Role-Playing genres as they dominate both production and popularity.

2. Reassess production strategy post-2011 decline — possible causes include digital distribution shifts or competition from mobile gaming.

3. Leverage Japan’s strong market performance by localizing content and prioritizing releases for Japanese audiences.

4. Explore innovation in underrepresented genres (Simulation, Sports, Platform) to tap into niche markets.

## Conclusion

The video game industry peaked around 2011 in both production and global sales but has since experienced a decline.
Action and Role-Playing remain the most influential genres, while Japan leads as the top-performing region.
Companies should focus on these genres and markets while diversifying to revitalize overall growth.
